# A Noob Plays with Vulkan

Just me playing with GLFW and Vulkan what could possibly go wrong...

# Achievements that still can be earned

These are not at all complete just some random thoughts on how to make things a bit more
entertaining the order is probably not really well thought. I will work on it as i go on.
* Devices everywhere (Understand the usage of Instance, Physical Devices and Logical Devices)
* Swap my Picture in (Understand Swapchains)
* Glue me a Window (Setup a basic VkSurface thats handled by GLFW)
* I will walk five hundred miles (just a placeholder for other achievements)
* Triangles everywhere (Draw a Triangle to the screen)
* Mushrooms (Draw a Triangle with a single color)
* Infected Mushrooms (Draw the good old opengl triangle with __all__ the colors)
* Plumbing for beginners (Setup a Vertexshader pipeline)
* The secret life of pixels (Setup a Pixelshader pipeline)
* Secret Hot Sauce (Translation of Shaders)
* Wait was that a talking cube ? (Draw a cube to the screen)
* Spaghetti Chef (Refactor your mess)
* Reached the NOOB Level (Enough knowledge to be dangerous with Vulkan ?!?)
* Break me a brick (Make a breakout clone)
